### ðŸ‘‹ This is Zehua Cheng

I am a D.Phil in Computer Science at the University of Oxford, doing interdisciplinary research between [Artificial Intelligence](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/research/ai_ml/) and [Drug Discovery](http://drugdiscovery.chem.ox.ac.uk/), supervised by [Professor Thomas Lukasiewicz](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/thomas.lukasiewicz/) in [Intelligent Systems Lab](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/thomas.lukasiewicz/isg-index.html). 
Currently I am working on building a cross-institutional, large-scale distributed machine learning system. I am working closely with many prominent medical institutions, such as Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Tsinghua Changgeng Hospital, etc. This system aimed to streamline the diagnostic process across these disparate facilities, thereby fostering greater collaboration and information sharing in a highly secure environment.
