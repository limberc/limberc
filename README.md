### ðŸ‘‹ This is Zehua Cheng

I am a D.Phil candidate in Computer Science at the University of Oxford, doing interdisciplinary research between [Artificial Intelligence](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/research/ai_ml/) and [Drug Discovery](http://drugdiscovery.chem.ox.ac.uk/), supervised by [Professor Thomas Lukasiewicz](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/thomas.lukasiewicz/) in [Intelligent Systems Lab](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/thomas.lukasiewicz/isg-index.html). I work with [Prof. Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/) and [Dr. Jie Fu](https://bigaidream.github.io/) at [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en/). My research interests including Drug-Protein Interaction, Protein 3D Structure Prediction and Multimodal Deep Learning.

I have a wide range of interests in the deep learning field, and I have been interested in large-scale distributed machine learning and model quantization. These experiences have led me to focus more on the practical application of deep learning.
